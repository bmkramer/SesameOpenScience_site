      <title>Crossref metadata for preprints: Discussions and recommendations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202211_metaarxiv_crossref/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Crossref launched a metadata schema for ‘posted content’ with the aim of better accommodating the metadata needs for preprints, working papers, theses, reports, and related outputs, which are not typically peer-reviewed. In 2021, Crossref formed an Advisory Group (AG) to discuss how the quality of metadata for preprints using this schema could be improved. The group focused on four topics: 1) preprints as an article type (rather than subtype of posted-content); 2) relationships to/from preprints; 3) versioning; and 4) withdrawal/removal of preprints. The recommendations that resulted from the group’s deliberations have been published previously. Here we provide further background to the recommendations and report more details of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The availability and completeness of open funder metadata</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202211_qss/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research funders spend considerable efforts collecting information on the outcomes of the research they fund. To help funders track publication output associated with their funding, Crossref initiated FundRef in 2013, enabling publishers to register funding information using persistent identifiers. However, it is hard to assess the coverage of funder metadata because it is unknown how many articles are the result of funded research and should therefore include funder metadata. In this paper we looked at 5,004 publications reported by researchers to be the result of funding by a specific funding agency: the Dutch Research Council NWO. Only 67% of these articles contain funding information in Crossref, with a subset acknowledging NWO as funder name and/or Funder IDs linked to NWO (53% and 45%, respectively). Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Dimensions are all able to infer additional funding information from funding statements in the full text of the articles. Funding information in Lens largely corresponds to that in Crossref, with some additional funding information likely taken from PubMed. We observe interesting differences between publishers in the coverage and completeness of funding metadata in Crossref compared to proprietary databases, highlighting the potential to increase the quality of open metadata on funding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: A preprint of this article was posted on MetaArXiv: &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/gj4hq&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/gj4hq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Preprints and open preprint review: a workshop on innovations in scholarly publishing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_upstream/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers, librarians, policy makers, and practitioners often complain about the scholarly publishing system, but the system also offers exciting opportunities to contribute to innovations in the way academic findings are disseminated and evaluated.&#xA;At the Dutch Open Science Festival, which took place at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam on September 1st 2022, we organized one of the ‘community-led’ workshops to discuss some of these developments, focusing on preprints and open preprint review. Participants discussed the opportunities offered by these innovations, and reflected on ways in which these innovations may complement, or perhaps even replace, traditional journal publishing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Talking Points: Bianca Kramer on publishing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_elife/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending 15 years as a librarian for the life sciences and medicine at Utrecht University, Bianca Kramer recently started her own consulting firm, Sesame Open Science, to provide advice and support for projects related to open science. Throughout her career Kramer has been a strong advocate for open science and innovations in scholarly communication. Here she discusses how academic publishing and the role of libraries and librarians have changed over recent decades, and what she hopes the publishing landscape will look like in ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Bianca Kramer is Keeping Tabs on Open Research</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202207_upstream/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being encouraged to keep “open tabs”, has been an interesting experience - turning something that’s usually guilt-inducing (“I really should be reading this…!”) into something that at least feels productive (“Oh, I could use this for the Upstream blog!”).&#xA;In the end, did I actually read more because I kept conscious track of all those open tabs? Or less, because I bookmarked the links for this blog and then neglected to read the actual content? I’ll leave that an open question&amp;hellip; Either way, this post lists some of the things that caught my eye over the last month or two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Language Diversity in Scholarly Publishing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202206_coki/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of lip service paid to the idea of diversity in scholarly publishing and often diversity of language is used as an example. But while the groups that work actively in languages other than English have been making this point consistently and forcefully, it has had limited traction in the scholarly anglophone literature, some nice counterexamples notwithstanding.&#xA;To address this gap, we have mapped the 122 million objects in Crossref up to the end of May 2022 to languages (based on titles and abstracts, where available) and done an initial analysis. The results are a mix of the expected and surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Advancing open access in the Netherlands after 2020: from quantity to quality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202106_insights/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202106_insights/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is to explore options to further open access in the Netherlands from 2021. Its premise is that there is a need to look at the qualitative aspects of open access, alongside quantitative ones. The article first takes stock of progress that has been made. Next, we suggest broadening the agenda by involving more types of actors and other scholarly formats (like books, chapters, proceedings, preprints and textbooks). At the same time we suggest deepening the open access agenda by including several open access dimensions: immediacy, diamond open access, open metadata, open peer review and open licences. To facilitate discussion, a framework is proposed that allows specifying these actions by the a) aspects of open access they address (what is made open access, how, when and where it is made open access, and copyright and rights retention), b) the actors that play a role (government, research institutions, funders) and c) the various levels at which these actions can be taken: state as goal, set as policy, legalize and promote, recognize and reward, finance, support with infrastructure. A template is provided to ease the use of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: A preprint of this article was posted on Zenodo: &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4455790&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4455790&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>An Open Knowledge Base for the Netherlands: Report of a Community Workshop</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202106_zenodo_okb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of developing a national Open Knowledge Base for the Netherlands (NL-OKB) has been proposed in response to the strategic needs of the research community in the Netherlands. In parallel with the work of the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/Open%20access/Engelstalige%20samenvatting%20opdracht%20werkgroep.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dutch Taskforce on Responsible Management of Research Information and Data&lt;/a&gt; addressing these opportunities and the preparation of a &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dialogic.nl/en/projects/haalbaarheidsstudie-open-knowledge-base/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;feasibility study by Dialogic&lt;/a&gt;, interested stakeholders were convened with the goal of identifying expert and user-community interests in and need for an NL-OKB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal in convening a workshop was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To gather evidence on the feasibility of an NL-OKB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To test the community interest and appetite for developing an NL-OKB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To identify a practical pathway forward towards startup and implementation of an NL-OKB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over two days, 19-20 November 2020, 35 participants representing national and international organisations met in a virtual workshop. This included representatives of VSNU, NWO, NFU, SURF, DANS, CWTS and a range of Netherlands institutions alongside international stakeholders such as Crossref, ORCID, OpenAIRE, DataCite, SPARC North America, Jisc, UKRI and others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was strong support for an NL-OKB amongst the assembled group. The group as a whole was strongly in favour of the development of an NL-OKB run on behalf of and controlled by the academic community. Of those present, virtually all indicated they had a direct stake and interest in supporting the development of an NL-OKB. International participants were also keen to see efforts in the Netherlands succeed as an exemplar to be drawn upon. The assembled group reached a series of consensus conclusions, that taken together provide the beginnings of a roadmap for further development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>OA Diamond Journals Study</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202103_zenodo_oadjs/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From June 2020 to February 2021, a consortium of 10 organisations undertook a large-scale study on open access journals across the world that are free for readers and authors, usually referred to as “OA diamond journals”. This study was commissioned by cOAlition S in order to gain a better understanding of the OA diamond landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study undertook a statistical analysis of several bibliographic databases, surveyed 1,619 journals, collected 7,019 free text submissions and other data from 94 questions, and organised three focus groups with 11 journals and 10 interviews with hosting platforms. It collected 163 references in the academic literature, and inventoried 1048 journals not listed in DOAJ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Findings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A wide archipelago of relatively small journals serving diverse communities&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OA diamond journals are on the road to full compliance with Plan S&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A mix of scientific strengths and operational challenges&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An economy that largely depends on volunteers, universities and government&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;</description>
