      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of developing a national Open Knowledge Base for the Netherlands (NL-OKB) has been proposed in response to the strategic needs of the research community in the Netherlands. In parallel with the work of the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/Open%20access/Engelstalige%20samenvatting%20opdracht%20werkgroep.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dutch Taskforce on Responsible Management of Research Information and Data&lt;/a&gt; addressing these opportunities and the preparation of a &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dialogic.nl/en/projects/haalbaarheidsstudie-open-knowledge-base/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;feasibility study by Dialogic&lt;/a&gt;, interested stakeholders were convened with the goal of identifying expert and user-community interests in and need for an NL-OKB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal in convening a workshop was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To gather evidence on the feasibility of an NL-OKB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To test the community interest and appetite for developing an NL-OKB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To identify a practical pathway forward towards startup and implementation of an NL-OKB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over two days, 19-20 November 2020, 35 participants representing national and international organisations met in a virtual workshop. This included representatives of VSNU, NWO, NFU, SURF, DANS, CWTS and a range of Netherlands institutions alongside international stakeholders such as Crossref, ORCID, OpenAIRE, DataCite, SPARC North America, Jisc, UKRI and others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was strong support for an NL-OKB amongst the assembled group. The group as a whole was strongly in favour of the development of an NL-OKB run on behalf of and controlled by the academic community. Of those present, virtually all indicated they had a direct stake and interest in supporting the development of an NL-OKB. International participants were also keen to see efforts in the Netherlands succeed as an exemplar to be drawn upon. The assembled group reached a series of consensus conclusions, that taken together provide the beginnings of a roadmap for further development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
