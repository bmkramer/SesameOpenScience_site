While OpenAlex provides a source of open abstracts in addition to Crossref, the takedown of abstracts from OpenAlex by two major publishers points to an increased commodification of abstracts.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Launched in 2020, the 
&lt;a href="https://i4oa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA)&lt;/a> advocates and promotes the unrestricted availability of abstracts of scholarly output, particularly journal articles and book chapters, in trusted repositories where they are open and machine-accessible. This has gained increased relevance with the rise of large language models (LLM) and generative AI. Access to high-quality textual content for training purposes is highly sought after, with the risk of further commodification by publishers and by developers of generative AI models and tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comments on EC Council Conclusions on scholarly publishing</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/thought/202306_ec/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/thought/202306_ec/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="featured_202306_ec.png" alt="featured image">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>On May 23, 2023, the Council of the European Union approved a set of conclusions on&lt;/em> &lt;em>&lt;strong>&amp;lsquo;High-quality, transparent, open, trustworthy and equitable scholarly publishing&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> &lt;em>(see 
&lt;a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9616-2023-INIT/en/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf&lt;/a>).&lt;/em>&lt;br>
&lt;em>Below are some of my thoughts on these conclusions.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think these Council Conclusions are very welcome and important, as they align with, and in turn can support, a number of important current developments in how open access is perceived and implemented. One of these is the growing awareness, also among research institutions and funders, of the inequality and unsustainability of APC-driven open access publishing, especially by commercial or otherwise revenue-driven publishers. Another is a growing emphasis on important qualitative aspects of open access, in particular immediacy and open licensing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
