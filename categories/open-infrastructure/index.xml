SCOSS is a pragmatic approach to investing in open infrastructure; one that allows stakeholder institutions to participate in the direct and immediate funding of essential infrastructure. It is not the only pathway or means to invest in open infrastructure.” — SCOSS website - What is SCOSS
For SCOSS, I am working together with participating infrastructures to develop strategies for achieving their funding goals, as well as to contribute to the general strategy of SCOSS.</description></item></channel></rss>
