This framework will seek to enable UKRI and the broader sector to assess progress towards Open Access, levels of compliance with the UKRI policy and its overall effectiveness. The M&amp;amp;E framework will also aim to establish how Open Access publication trends affect academic practices and society, where possible.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I worked as associate to Research Consulting on this project, which identified a series of potential M&amp;amp;E questions, approaches to answer them, their feasibility and expected resource intensity.
In a follow-up project, we developed a set of baseline values for open access research articles, against which future progress can be assessed. The analysis was based exclusively on open data sources and the data and code have been made available to enable reuse, in line with UKRI’s commitment to open research.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this project, we assess and compare the value added by OpenAlex to Crossref metadata, both in coverage of publications and other research output (with and without DOIs) as well as in coverage of metadata (including identifiers) for authors, institutions, publication venues and disciplines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are working to extend the project to provide an automated workflow to compare any two (open) metadata sources.&lt;/p>
