These ‘no fee’ publishing models are collectively known as Diamond Open Access. Diamond publishers often face similar fragmentation issues, varying service quality, visibility, and sustainability.&amp;rdquo;

This framework will seek to enable UKRI and the broader sector to assess progress towards Open Access, levels of compliance with the UKRI policy and its overall effectiveness. The M&amp;amp;E framework will also aim to establish how Open Access publication trends affect academic practices and society, where possible.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I worked as associate to Research Consulting on this project, which identified a series of potential M&amp;amp;E questions, approaches to answer them, their feasibility and expected resource intensity.
In a follow-up project, we developed a set of baseline values for open access research articles, against which future progress can be assessed. The analysis was based exclusively on open data sources and the data and code have been made available to enable reuse, in line with UKRI’s commitment to open research.&lt;/p>

This is reflected in a number of related activities aimed at charting the changing scholarly communication landscape.

&lt;p>We created an overview of current and expected developments and models to get a grip on the abundance and variety of research tools used across the research cycle. We are charting the creation and availability (supply side) and usage (demand side) of research tools. We continue to investigate why researchers use certain tools, to find out what tool usage patterns can tell us about the changes in scholarly communication, and, finally, to uncover the driving forces behind the creation and innovation of research tools and the (lack of) interoperability of these tools.&lt;/p>
