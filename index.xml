In 2021, Crossref formed an Advisory Group (AG) to discuss how the quality of metadata for preprints using this schema could be improved. The group focused on four topics: 1) preprints as an article type (rather than subtype of posted-content); 2) relationships to/from preprints; 3) versioning; and 4) withdrawal/removal of preprints.</description></item><item><title>The availability and completeness of open funder metadata</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202211_qss/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202211_qss/</guid><description>Research funders spend considerable efforts collecting information on the outcomes of the research they fund. To help funders track publication output associated with their funding, Crossref initiated FundRef in 2013, enabling publishers to register funding information using persistent identifiers. However, it is hard to assess the coverage of funder metadata because it is unknown how many articles are the result of funded research and should therefore include funder metadata. In this paper we looked at 5,004 publications reported by researchers to be the result of funding by a specific funding agency: the Dutch Research Council NWO.</description></item><item><title>Preprints and open preprint review: a workshop on innovations in scholarly publishing</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_upstream/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_upstream/</guid><description>Researchers, librarians, policy makers, and practitioners often complain about the scholarly publishing system, but the system also offers exciting opportunities to contribute to innovations in the way academic findings are disseminated and evaluated. At the Dutch Open Science Festival, which took place at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam on September 1st 2022, we organized one of the ‘community-led’ workshops to discuss some of these developments, focusing on preprints and open preprint review.</description></item><item><title>Q&amp;A about Wiley's decision to open its abstracts</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_leidenmadtrics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_leidenmadtrics/</guid><description>In this post Ludo Waltman and Bianca Kramer reflect on today’s announcement that Wiley is joining the Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA) and is going to make abstracts openly available through Crossref.</description></item><item><title>SCOSS</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/project/scoss/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/project/scoss/</guid><description>“SCOSS-supported open science infrastructure provides the scientific and scholarly community with resources and services to access, share, and assess research. SCOSS is a pragmatic approach to investing in open infrastructure; one that allows stakeholder institutions to participate in the direct and immediate funding of essential infrastructure. It is not the only pathway or means to invest in open infrastructure.” — SCOSS website - What is SCOSS
For SCOSS, I am working together with participating infrastructures to develop strategies for achieving their funding goals, as well as to contribute to the general strategy of SCOSS.</description></item><item><title>Measuring what matters - open to interpretation ?</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/talk/202210_lis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/talk/202210_lis/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Talking Points: Bianca Kramer on publishing</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_elife/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/publication/202210_elife/</guid><description>After spending 15 years as a librarian for the life sciences and medicine at Utrecht University, Bianca Kramer recently started her own consulting firm, Sesame Open Science, to provide advice and support for projects related to open science. Throughout her career Kramer has been a strong advocate for open science and innovations in scholarly communication. Here she discusses how academic publishing and the role of libraries and librarians have changed over recent decades, and what she hopes the publishing landscape will look like in ten years.</description></item><item><title>Open abstracts in SSH – current state and challenges</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/talk/202209_triple/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/talk/202209_triple/</guid><description/></item><item><title>New developments in preprinting and preprint review</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/talk/202209_npos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/talk/202209_npos/</guid><description>The workshop introduced participants to preprinting and preprint peer review.

In the end, did I actually read more because I kept conscious track of all those open tabs? Or less, because I bookmarked the links for this blog and then neglected to read the actual content?</description></item><item><title>UKRI / Research Consulting</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/project/rc-ukri/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/project/rc-ukri/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A new study commissioned by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) framework for their Open Access policy.

But while the groups that work actively in languages other than English have been making this point consistently and forcefully, it has had limited traction in the scholarly anglophone literature, some nice counterexamples notwithstanding. To address this gap, we have mapped the 122 million objects in Crossref up to the end of May 2022 to languages (based on titles and abstracts, where available) and done an initial analysis.</description></item><item><title>COKI Open metadata report</title><link>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/project/coki_open_metadata_report/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bmkramer.github.io/SesameOpenScience_site/project/coki_open_metadata_report/</guid><description>Open, automated workflow to compare coverage and quality of (open) metadata sources.
