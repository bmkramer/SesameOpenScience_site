  The concept of developing a national Open Knowledge Base for the Netherlands (NL-OKB) has been proposed in response to the strategic needs of the research community in the Netherlands. In parallel with the work of the [Dutch Taskforce on Responsible Management of Research Information and Data](https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/Open%20access/Engelstalige%20samenvatting%20opdracht%20werkgroep.pdf) addressing these opportunities and the preparation of a [feasibility study by Dialogic](https://www.dialogic.nl/en/projects/haalbaarheidsstudie-open-knowledge-base/), interested stakeholders were convened with the goal of identifying expert and user-community interests in and need for an NL-OKB.

The goal in convening a workshop was:
1.    To gather evidence on the feasibility of an NL-OKB
2.    To test the community interest and appetite for developing an NL-OKB
3.    To identify a practical pathway forward towards startup and implementation of an NL-OKB

Over two days, 19-20 November 2020, 35 participants representing national and international organisations met in a virtual workshop. This included representatives of VSNU, NWO, NFU, SURF, DANS, CWTS and a range of Netherlands institutions alongside international stakeholders such as Crossref, ORCID, OpenAIRE, DataCite, SPARC North America, Jisc, UKRI and others.

There was strong support for an NL-OKB amongst the assembled group. The group as a whole was strongly in favour of the development of an NL-OKB run on behalf of and controlled by the academic community. Of those present, virtually all indicated they had a direct stake and interest in supporting the development of an NL-OKB. International participants were also keen to see efforts in the Netherlands succeed as an exemplar to be drawn upon. The assembled group reached a series of consensus conclusions, that taken together provide the beginnings of a roadmap for further development.
