title: "Language Diversity in Scholarly Publishing"
---

  There is a lot of lip service paid to the idea of diversity in scholarly publishing and often diversity of language is used as an example. But while the groups that work actively in languages other than English have been making this point consistently and forcefully, it has had limited traction in the scholarly anglophone literature, some nice counterexamples notwithstanding. 
  To address this gap, we have mapped the 122 million objects in Crossref up to the end of May 2022 to languages (based on titles and abstracts, where available) and done an initial analysis. The results are a mix of the expected and surprising.
