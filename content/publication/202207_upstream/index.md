title: "Bianca Kramer is Keeping Tabs on Open Research"

  Being encouraged to keep “open tabs”, has been an interesting experience - turning something that’s usually guilt-inducing (“I really should be reading this…!”) into something that at least feels productive (“Oh, I could use this for the Upstream blog!”). 
  In the end, did I actually read more because I kept conscious track of all those open tabs? Or less, because I bookmarked the links for this blog and then neglected to read the actual content? I’ll leave that an open question... Either way, this post lists some of the things that caught my eye over the last month or two.
