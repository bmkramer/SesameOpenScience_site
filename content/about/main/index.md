  In 2022, I moved to an independent consulting/research analyst role, after having been scholarly communication/open science librarian at Utrecht University Library for 15 years. My focus is open science, open metadata and open infrastructure.

  I am co-leading the'Innovations in Scholarly Communication' project which investigates trends in innovations in scholarly communication across the research cycle, and have organized many interactive workshops on open science.
  
  Alongside providing detailed analyses of the open science transition in the Netherlands over the past ten years I have delivered strategic information for cOAlitionS and the European Commission.

  I am founding member of the Initiative for Open Abstracts (I4OA) and am currently a member of the Preprint Advisory Group of Crossref, as well as the Europe PMC and Literature Services Scientific Advisory Board of EMBL-EBI.
