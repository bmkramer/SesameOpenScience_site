#### Open, automated workflow to compare coverage and quality of (open) metadata sources.

---
In this project, we assess and compare the value added by OpenAlex to Crossref metadata, both in coverage of publications and other research output (with and without DOIs) as well as in coverage of metadata (including identifiers) for authors, institutions, publication venues and disciplines.

We are working to extend the project to provide an automated workflow to compare any two (open) metadata sources.

*Role: collaboration with Cameron Neylon (Curtin University)*  
*Time period: March 2022 - ongoing*
