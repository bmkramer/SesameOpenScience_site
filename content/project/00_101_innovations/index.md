title: 101 Innovations in Scholarly Communication
---


#### We are interested in the way information is created, shared, and processed in academia. This is reflected in a number of related activities aimed at charting the changing scholarly communication landscape.


---

 We created an overview of current and expected developments and models to get a grip on the abundance and variety of research tools used across the research cycle. We are charting the creation and availability (supply side) and usage (demand side) of research tools. We continue to investigate why researchers use certain tools, to find out what tool usage patterns can tell us about the changes in scholarly communication, and, finally, to uncover the driving forces behind the creation and innovation of research tools and the (lack of) interoperability of these tools.
