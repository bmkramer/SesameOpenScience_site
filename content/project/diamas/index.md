#### "In the transition towards Open Access, institutional publishing is challenged by fragmentation and varying service quality, visibility,and sustainability."

To address this issue, the Horizon Europe project DIAMAS will:

+ Map the current landscape of Institutional Publishing Service Providers (IPSPs)
+ Coordinate and improve the efficiency and quality of IPSPs by developing an Extensible Quality Standard for Institutional Publishing (EQSIP)
+ Formulate community-led, actionable recommendations and strategies for institutional leaders, funders/sponsors/donors, and policymakers.
