#### “SCOSS-supported open science infrastructure provides the scientific and scholarly community with resources and services to access, share, and assess research. SCOSS is a pragmatic approach to investing in open infrastructure; one that allows stakeholder institutions to participate in the direct and immediate funding of essential infrastructure. It is not the only pathway or means to invest in open infrastructure.”

For SCOSS, I am working together with participating infrastructures to develop strategies for achieving their funding goals, as well as to contribute to the general strategy of SCOSS.

I see this an exciting opportunity in a research ecosystem where research organizations and funders increasingly recognize the importance of open scholarly infrastructure and face important choices in how to spend their budget.     

*Role: community strategy and support*  
*Time period: October 2022 - April 2024*
