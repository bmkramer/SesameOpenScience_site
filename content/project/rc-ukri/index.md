#### "A new study commissioned by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for their Open Access policy. This framework will seek to enable UKRI and the broader sector to assess progress towards Open Access, levels of compliance with the UKRI policy and its overall effectiveness. The M&E framework will also aim to establish how Open Access publication trends affect academic practices and society, where possible."

I am working as associate to Research Consulting on this project, which will be identifying a series of potential M&E questions, approaches to answer them, their feasibility and expected resource intensity. We anticipate that the M&E framework will employ a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures, to account for the diversity of practices and stakeholders across the research landscape. We will also be considering information sources and datasets that can yield useful insights while minimising reporting burdens, with a preference for open data sources.
